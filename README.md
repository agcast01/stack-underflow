## Summary

Stack Underflow is a site made by developers for developers. This is a place where you can go ask questions and hopefully get answers.

## Running the application

In order to run the application you need to have pipenv and npm on your device. The backend already comes with a
Pipfile and a requirements file to install the correct versions. There is also a package.json file in the react-app directory that you can use npm install to get the necessary modules for the frontend. From there you just have to start the flask app and also the react app, using pipenv and npm respectively.
